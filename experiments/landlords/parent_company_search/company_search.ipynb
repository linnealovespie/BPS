    "# Step 0: Clean up Seattle OSE Data \n",
    "Seattle's [Office of Sustainability and Environment](https://www.seattle.gov/environment) has released emissions data for buildings in the city from 2015 to 2021. Building owners over 20,000 sq.ft. are required to self-report annually to the city of Seattle. Features of the data include:\n",
    "- building name\n",
    "- address\n",
    "- tax parcel identification number\n",
    "- council district the building is located within\n",
    "- buliding type\n",
    "- different metrics for emissions. \n",
    "More metadata about the energy benchmarking datasets can be found [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/2021-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/bfsh-nrm6).\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing initial exploratory analysis, we noticed that not all of the council district codes were correct. To rectify this we got the official council district boundaries form [Seattle GeoData Portal](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/seattle-city-council-districts-for-council-members-serving-through-2023/explore) in the form of a geojson file [`Council_Districts.geojson`](../../../data/Council_Districts.geojson). For each address in the OSE building efficiency dataset, we convert it to a (latitude, longitude) point and confirmed with which council distirct it belonged to. \n",

    "To use:\n",

    "1. Instantiate an instance of the `ParcelLookupHelper` class, including the file path where you want to save your results.\n",
    "2. Run the `scrape_parcel_owners` method. Params:\n",
    "    - `tax_parcel_id_numbers` (list): a list of the tax parcel IDs you want to look up\n",
    "    - `file_name` (str): the file name to save the results\n",
    "    - `get_unit_details` (bool): whether or not to create a JSON file of the types of units in each building. Defaults to `False`. \n",

    "- This is a web scraping script, so it is highly dependent on the HTML structure of the Property Detail pages. Test it to make sure you're getting the correct data in case the HTML structure has changed since this script was written.\n",
    "- eRealProperty restricts you to 1,000 calls a day from a given IP address. You can divide your buildings into chunks of 1,000 and do this over several days or divide them between team members. Using different AWS or Google Cloud instances is possible but probably a bit rude. You could also use a VPN for similar results. Either way, you'll have to manually chunk this up into calls of 1,000 at least.\n"
