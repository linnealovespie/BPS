Policy Proposal

Large buildings (>50k sq ft)

- Large buildings decarbonize using a much more aggressive version of the January proposal, reducing target by 75%

Small buildings (<50k sq ft)

- Small buildings decarbonize using a slightly more aggressive version of the January proposal, reducing the targets by 25%

With this model, we still hit a 90% reduction by 2040.
